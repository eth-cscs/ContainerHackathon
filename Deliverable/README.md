# ESiWACE2 -- Deliverable D2.8
# Summary of Container Hackathon Experiences

## Deliverable

As specified in the ESiWACE2 Project Plan, the final deliverable contains a public-domain summary of our container hackathon experiences.  This contains: (1) a basic report describing the event, its objectives, results and some conclusions about the viability of such a hackathon to 'boot-strap' containerisation projects; (2) the reports of the individual teams which describe their activities and results in considerable detail; (3) a survey taken of all the participants about their impressions of the event.
